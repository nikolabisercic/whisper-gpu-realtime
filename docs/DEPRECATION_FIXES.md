# Deprecation Fixes Applied & Optimizations

## 1. Docker Compose Version (Fixed ✓)
- **Issue**: `version: '3.8'` attribute is obsolete
- **Fix**: Removed the version line from `docker-compose.yml`
- **Impact**: None - Docker Compose v2+ ignores this field anyway

## 2. NVIDIA CUDA Base Image (Fixed ✓)
- **Issue**: `nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04` is deprecated
- **Fix**: Updated to `nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu22.04` (latest stable)
- **Impact**: Better compatibility and longer support
- **Note**: You'll need to rebuild the backend image: `docker compose build backend`

## 3. FastAPI @app.on_event (Fixed ✓)
- **Issue**: `@app.on_event("startup")` is deprecated
- **Fix**: Replaced with lifespan context manager
- **Impact**: None - same functionality, modern approach

## 4. Docker Compose Command (Fixed ✓)
- **Issue**: `docker-compose` (with hyphen) is the old v1 command
- **Fix**: Updated all documentation to use `docker compose` (space, not hyphen)
- **Impact**: Uses Docker Compose v2 which is faster and has better features

## Next Steps

To apply these fixes, rebuild your Docker images:

```bash
# Stop current containers
docker compose down

# Rebuild with updated base image
docker compose build

# Start services
docker compose up
```

The deprecation warnings should now be resolved!

## 5. Build Performance Optimization (Added ✓)
- **Enhancement**: Added `COMPOSE_BAKE=true` to `.env` file
- **Benefit**: Enables Docker Buildx Bake for faster parallel builds
- **Impact**: Significant speed improvement when building multiple services
- **How it works**: 
  - Builds frontend and backend in parallel (when possible)
  - Better build cache management
  - Optimized build graph execution

With COMPOSE_BAKE enabled, future builds will be faster, especially when rebuilding both services!
